idea:
  title: How many characters can a model keep track of?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Large language models have a limited capacity to track and distinguish
    multiple characters and their attributes in long-form narrative text; measuring
    the point at which models begin to struggle can provide insight into the mechanisms
    they use for entity tracking.

    '
  background:
    description: "Some stories have a lot of characters\u2014think War and Peace or\
      \ the Tale of Genji. Given a new story, in-context, how many different characters\
      \ can a model keep track of? And can we use the points at which the model struggles\
      \ to help us figure out what mechanism it uses to keep track of different characters\
      \ and their attributes? How good are models at this anyway?"
